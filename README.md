Nearly Half of the customers are married with 48%. 77% of our customers have no dependents while the rest is evenly distributed between having 1 or 2 or three or more dependents.

Customers who have dependents are most likely to stay in the company. While 32% of customers who have no dependents churned.

51% of our customers have a month-to-month contract type, the rest are nearly distributed across the 1-year and 2-year contract. But we can see the highest revenue comes from the 2-year contract with 42% of the total revenue.
