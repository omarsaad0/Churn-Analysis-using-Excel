Nearly Half of the customers are married with 48%. 77% of our customers have no dependents while the rest is evenly distributed between having 1 or 2 or three or more dependents.

51% of our customers have a month-to-month contract type, the rest are nearly distributed across the 1-year and 2-year contract. But we can see the highest revenue comes from the 2-year contract with 42% of the total revenue. 

### **Offers vs. Churn**

We can see that moving from offer A to offer E will increase the chance of the customer churn. Offer E has 52% churn rate 


## Churn Reasons

45 % of customers churned were due to the competitor.
In each category there are detailed reasons, so let’s investigate the competitor category.
One third of churned customers due to competitors leaves due to better offers, 1 third due to better devices and the rest due to more data and higher download speed.

We can summarize the top 6 reasons for churn.

### **Satisfaction Score**

Customers who score 1 or 2 will definitely churn, while 16% of customers who scored 3 churned. So as long as the customer scores higher satisfaction score will most likely stay.

### **Churn Score**

The churn rate in the company is 27%, 45% of them churned due to competitor reasons. And the top reason was because the competitor has better devices and better offers. 
Speaking of offers 56% people churned when they didn’t receive an offer and as long as the offer is higher the customer will most likely stay in the company 
We lost because of competitor reasons 1.7 millions compared to the 2nd top reason which is dissatisfaction with 0.58 million.
We can see that the customer will be more likely to churn if have no dependents with 95% of churned customers were not having dependents. 
Half of churned customers were in their first year with us while this % dropped to 15% after the second year.
We could reduce the churn rate if we offered the new customers a better offer and included a better devices in our stores.
